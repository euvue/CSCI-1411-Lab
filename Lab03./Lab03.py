# This lab is a program that asks the user input of length
# and width of a box in inches.
# It calculates the perimeter of the box, how many trims
# boards the user will need,
# the cost of the total trim boards, 
# how much trim is wasted, and
# how much money the user wasted.

def main():
    full_name = ( input ( 'Enter your full name: '))  # Prompts user input full name

    print(full_name) # prints the user's input of full name

    length_box = int ( input ('Enter the length of the box in inches: ' ))   # prompts user input for the length of the box

    width_box = float ( input ('Enter the width of the box in inches: ' ))   # prompts user input for the width of the box
